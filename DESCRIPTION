Description: The wbCorr package separates the variance of variables
    provided into their within- and between-cluster components, and
    calculates the respective bivariate correlations for both levels
    separately. This is especially useful for longitudinal analyses.  By
    centering the variables within and between clusters, this package
    helps users gain an initial understanding of their data before
    employing more sophisticated multilevel analyses. This approach allows
    for a more in-depth examination of relationships at both the within-
    and between-cluster levels, which can be essential for making informed
    decisions based on the structure of the data.
