Description: The wbCorr package separates the variance of variables provided 
into their within- and between-cluster components, and calculates the respective 
bivariate correlations for both levels separately. This is especially useful
for longitudinal analyses.
By centering the variables within and between clusters, this package helps 
users gain an initial understanding of their data before employing more 
sophisticated multilevel analyses. This approach allows for a more in-depth 
examination of relationships at both the within- and between-cluster 
levels, which can be essential for making informed decisions based on the 
structure of the data.
