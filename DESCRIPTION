Description: The package separates the variance of variables passes as a dataframe into
  their within- and between- components and calculates the respective bivariate
  correlations for both levels separately. This is achieved by centering the variables
  within and between cluster. This is useful to get a first understanding
  of your data before using more elaborate multilevel analyses.
